            Lionel Messi celebrated his sixth Ballon D`Or award with a brilliant hat-trick as Barcelona moved back top of La Liga with an emphatic 5-2 victory over Real Mallorca on Saturday.
Real Madrid had climbed three points clear after beating Espanyol, but Ernesto Valverde`s side were at their vibrant best as they dispatched visitors Mallorca at the Camp Nou.
Antoine Griezmann dinked home the opening goal after being played through by Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen, six-times Ballon dâ€™Or winner Messi twice curled home from outside the area and Luis Suarez netted a brilliant backheel.
Ante Budimir scored with a deflected effort for Mallorca in the first half and doubled his tally by nodding home, but Messi smashed a shot in late on to complete his hat-trick and round off an impressive win for the Catalans.
Messi presented his sixth golden ball award to the supporters before the game, before putting on a show which highlights why he is considered the best player on the planet.

            Lionel Messi has hit back at Barcelona sporting director Eric Abidal after the Frenchman blamed slackness in the dressing room for the departure of recently-fired coach Ernesto Valverde. In an interview with Spanish daily Sport Abidal said that under Valverde, who was sacked in mid-January, many players had been unhappy, hadn't worked hard enough nor communicated properly.
Now Argentine ace Messi has fired a salvo across his own ranks just as the club is trying to get him to sign a contract extension. 
"Sincerely I don't like doing this kind of thing but everyone has to be made responsible for their actions and what they say," Messi said on Instagram. "We the players in the dressing room are the first to admit it when we haven't played well. The directors need to take their responsibilities too.
Messi later teed up Jordi Alba with a scooped pass but the defender fired just wide, while Barca`s all-time top scorer was uncharacteristically sloppy at times and miscontrolled a clear opportunity to strike at goal in the second half.Midfielder Ivan Rakitic admitted Barca had struggled for parts of the match."Real Madrid had a lot of chances in the first half, it was tough for us but then we had a few opportunities. It was a game that could have been decided by the odd goal but it wasn`t to be," said the Croatian.

    Record 30-times winners Barcelona were sent crashing out of the Copa del Rey in a 1-0 defeat at Athletic Bilbao on Thursday after a stoppage-time header from Inaki Williams.
Spanish striker Williams glanced a cross into the bottom corner to spark jubilant scenes at a rocking San Mames stadium and recalled Aritz Aduriz`s added-time goal in Athletic`s 1-0 home win over Barca on the first day of the Liga season.
They join Real Sociedad, Granada and second-tier Mirandes in Friday`s semi-final draw, which will not include Real Madrid, Barca or Atletico Madrid for the first time in 17 years.
The defeat heaped more misery on Barca in a tough week for the Catalans in which captain Lionel Messi spoke out against sporting director Eric Abidal and forward Ousmane Dembele was ruled out for the rest of the season with a hamstring injury.
Barca defender Gerard Pique said the team needed to show unity and refrain from in-fighting, adding that the performance, if not the result, proved that they had moved on from the saga.

    Real Madrid outplayed Barcelona for large parts of Wednesday`s La Liga clash but were unable to make their dominance count and the `Clasico` ended goalless to leave the Catalans top of the standings on goal difference.
    Both sides had shots cleared off the line and Real`s Gareth Bale did put the ball in the net after the interval but his strike was narrowly ruled out for offside and the fixture ended scoreless for the first time since November, 2002.
    The draw left Barca top on 36 points after 17 games with Real also on 36, five clear of third-placed Sevilla.The game was rescheduled from Oct. 26 due to the political turmoil that gripped Catalonia after separatist leaders were given lengthy jail sentences two months ago and was played amid a protest in favour of independence near the stadium.
    Loud chants of "independence" and "freedom" greeted kick-off while many supporters held up flags reading "Spain Sit and Talk" distributed by protest organisers in a call for dialogue between the central government and Catalonia.
